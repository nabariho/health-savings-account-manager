## Special Rules and Limitations

### Last-Month Rule
If you become HSA-eligible during the year, you may be able to make the full annual contribution if you remain eligible through December 31st and the entire following year.

### Testing Period
If you use the Last-Month Rule, you must remain HSA-eligible for the entire following year (testing period) or face penalties and taxes on excess contributions.

### Married Filing Separately
If you are married filing separately and both spouses have HSAs:
- Each spouse can contribute up to their individual limit
- Catch-up contributions apply individually if age 55 or older

### Employer Contributions
- Employer contributions count toward your annual limit
- Employer contributions are not taxable income to you
- You cannot deduct employer contributions on your tax return

## Pro-Rating Rules

### Mid-Year Changes in Coverage
Contributions may be pro-rated based on:
- Number of months you were HSA-eligible
- Type of coverage (self-only vs. family)
- Changes in HDHP status

### Example Scenarios
**Scenario 1:** Employee becomes HSA-eligible in July
- Eligible months: July-December (6 months)
- Self-only maximum: $4,150 × 6/12 = $2,075

**Scenario 2:** Employee changes from self-only to family coverage mid-year
- Jan-June self-only: $4,150 × 6/12 = $2,075
- July-Dec family: $8,300 × 6/12 = $4,150
- Total allowed: $6,225

## Age-Based Rules

### Catch-Up Contributions
- Available to individuals age 55 or older
- Additional $1,000 per year
- Both spouses can make catch-up contributions if both are 55+
- Each spouse needs their own HSA for separate catch-up contributions

### Medicare Enrollment
- HSA contributions must stop the month before Medicare enrollment
- Existing HSA funds can still be used for qualified expenses
- No penalty for continued ownership after 65

## Excess Contribution Rules

### Excess Contribution Penalties
- 6% excise tax per year on excess amounts
- Must be corrected by removing excess plus earnings
- Deadline for correction: Due date of tax return (including extensions)

### Correction Methods
1. **Withdrawal Method:** Remove excess contribution and attributable earnings
2. **Carry-Forward Method:** Apply excess to next year's contribution limit (if eligible)

## Income Limits

### No Income Phase-Out
Unlike other tax-advantaged accounts, HSAs have:
- No income limits for contributions
- No phase-out of contribution limits based on income
- Available to all income levels (subject to eligibility requirements)

## Contribution Timing

### Deadline for Contributions
- Prior tax year contributions: April 15th (tax filing deadline)
- Current tax year contributions: Can be made throughout the year
- No requirement for equal monthly contributions

### Best Practices
- Front-load contributions early in the year for maximum tax-free growth
- Consider payroll deductions for FICA tax savings (if available)
- Track contributions carefully to avoid exceeding limits

## State Tax Considerations

### State Conformity
Most states conform to federal HSA tax treatment, but some exceptions exist:
- California: HSA contributions are taxable income
- New Jersey: HSA contributions are taxable income
- Alabama: Limited deduction for HSA contributions

### Employer Considerations
- Some states may tax employer HSA contributions
- Consult state-specific guidance for compliance
- Consider impact on payroll tax calculations
